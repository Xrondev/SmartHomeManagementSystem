# SmartHomeManagementSystem
A 4951 Capstone Project Repo.

--- 
## Notice
The original documents is constructed in YuQue. In the documents you can find a detailed set of instructions of how to build up the environment. Plus, we provided a basic image for you to directly run the HASS system.  
Note the image's default auth token is: **hasshome/hasshome**.  
The FRP service on server side will not be maintained if the server load is heavy for other tasks. You may want to construct your own server platform to do the intranet penetration (for remote access) when it comes to Phase 2.  
You can always view the original dev log through the [link](https://www.yuque.com/elysium-gigg0/lwng7m/hq71i207erihkaw2?)  
The following part described the work we done in Phase 1.
## To continue the work
We have helped you to find a possible platform, the Home Assistant operating system, to fully achieve the requirements in the SRS documents. Plus, a detailed log is maintained to help you build the platform on the Raspberry Pi and the server.  
The OS image inside the doc already solved most of the problems you may meet so you can quickly build up your own environment. In addition, the system itself is vunerable and may fail if misconfigured. So, the image may help you quickly get started and get recovered from disaster crash.
we suggest you to FORK this repo to your group and continue the phase 2. When phase 2 accomplished, we hope you may make a PR to this repo and merge all our changes.
